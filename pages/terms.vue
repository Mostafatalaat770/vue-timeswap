      <p>
        Timeswap is a decentralized and autonomous fixed maturity lending and
        borrowing protocol on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to swap
        between present ERC20 tokens and future ERC20 tokens in a peer to peer
        manner via a constant product automated market maker algorithm for the
        interest and collateral calculation (the Timeswap Protocol). The
        Timeswap Protocol comprises a factory contract, together with ancillary
        smart contracts as necessary (each, a Smart Contract) deployed on the
        Ethereum blockchain that creates liquidity pool contracts for any pair
        of ERC20 tokens, one as the asset and the other as the collateral, and
        at any maturity date. The factory contract is a permission-less contract
        that allows any user to create a pool containing their choice of assets,
        and swap assets between each other in a peer to peer manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        The website at http://timeswap.io/ provides a front-end interface which
        visualises the Timeswap Protocol (the App); using the App, users can
        interact with the underlying Smart Contracts to create liquidity pools,
        swap assets in a peer to peer manner, and interact with other users
        within the Timeswap ecosystem. Using the App or the Timeswap Protocol
        may require that you pay a fee, such as gas charges on the Ethereum
        blockchain network to perform a transaction. You acknowledge and agree
        that Timeswap has no control over any transactions, the method of
        payment of any transactions, or any actual payments of transactions. You
        must ensure that you have a sufficient balance (in ETH or any ERC20
        token) to complete any transaction on the App or the Timeswap Protocol
        before initiating such transaction.
      </p>
      <p>

        intricacies of digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and
        other digital tokens such as those following the Ethereum Token Standard
        (ERC-20). You further understand that the markets for these digital
        assets are highly volatile due to factors including (but not limited to)
        adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You
        acknowledge that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic
        and blockchain-based systems such as Ethereum are variable and may
        increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge the risk that
        your digital assets may lose some or all of their value while they are
        supplied to the Timeswap Protocol. If you borrow digital assets from the
        Timeswap Protocol, you will have to supply digital assets of your own as
        collateral. If your collateral declines in value such that it is no
        longer sufficient to secure the amount that you borrowed, others may
        interact with the Timeswap Protocol to seize your collateral in a
        liquidation event. You further acknowledge that we are not responsible
        for any of these variables or risks, do not own or control the Timeswap
        Protocol, and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you
        experience while accessing or using the App. ACCORDINGLY, YOU UNDERSTAND
        AND AGREE TO ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL OF THE RISKS OF
        ACCESSING AND USING THE APP AND INTERACTING WITH THE TIMESWAP PROTOCOL.
        YOU FURTHER EXPRESSLY WAIVE AND RELEASE US FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY,
        CLAIMS, CAUSES OF ACTION, OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR IN ANY WAY RELATING
        TO YOUR USE OF THE APP AND YOUR INTERACTION WITH THE TIMESWAP PROTOCOL.
      </p>
      <p>1. THIRD-PARTY RESOURCES AND PROMOTIONS</p>
      <p>
        The App may contain references or links to third-party resources,
        including (but not limited to) information, materials, products, or
        services, that we do not own or control. In addition, third parties may
        offer promotions related to your access and use of the App. We do not
        endorse or assume any responsibility for any such resources or
        promotions. If you access any such resources or participate in any such
        promotions, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that these
        Terms does not apply to your dealings or relationships with any third
        parties. You expressly relieve us of any and all liability arising from
        your use of any such resources or participation in any such promotions.
      </p>
      <p>1. INDEMNITY</p>
      <p>
        You agree to hold harmless, release, defend, and indemnify us and our
        officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, and
        subsidiaries from and against all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
        liabilities, costs, and expenses arising from: (a) your access and use
        of the App; (b) your violation of any term or condition of these Terms
        or the right of any third party; (c) your violation of any applicable
        law, rule, or regulation; and (d) any other party’s access and use of
        the App with your assistance or using any device that you own or
        control. You agree that Timeswap will have control of the defence or
        settlement of any such claims.
      </p>
      <p>1. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</p>
      <p>
        Under no circumstances shall we or any of our officers, directors,
        employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable to
        you for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or
        exemplary damages, including (but not limited to) damages for loss of
        profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible property, arising out
        of or relating to any access or use of the App, nor will we be
        responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking,
        tampering, or other unauthorized access or use of the App or the
        information contained within it. We assume no liability or
        responsibility for any: (a) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of
        content; (b) personal injury or property damage, of any nature
        whatsoever, resulting from any access or use of the App; (c)
        unauthorized access or use of any secure server or database in our
        control, or the use of any information or data stored therein; (d)
        interruption or cessation of function related to the App; (e) bugs,
        viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or
        through the App; (f) errors or omissions in, or loss or damage incurred
        as a result of the use of, any content made available through the App;
        and (g) the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third
        party. Under no circumstances shall we or any of our officers,
        directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries
        be liable to you for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations,
        damages, losses, or costs in an amount exceeding the amount you paid to
        us in exchange for access to and use of the App, or $100.00, whichever
        is greater. This limitation of liability applies regardless of whether
        the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict
        liability, or any other basis, and even if we have been advised of the
        possibility of such liability. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
        exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of
        certain liabilities and damages. Accordingly, some of the disclaimers
        and limitations set forth in these Terms may not apply to you. This
        limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by
        law.
      </p>
      <p>1. TERMINATION</p>
      <p>
        You may terminate these Terms at any time by discontinuing your access
        to and use of the App. You will not receive any refunds if you terminate
        these Terms. You agree that we, in our sole discretion and for any or no
        reason, may terminate these Terms and suspend and/or terminate your
        access to the App. You agree that any suspension or termination of your
        access to the App may be without prior notice, and that we will not be
        liable to you or to any third party for any such suspension or
        termination. If we terminate these Terms or suspend or terminate your
        access to or use of the App due to your breach of these Terms or any
        suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity, then termination of
        these Terms will be in addition to any other remedies we may have at law
        or in equity. Upon any termination or expiration of these Terms, whether
        by you or us, you may no longer have access to information that you have
        posted on the App, and you acknowledge that we will have no obligation
        to maintain any such information in our databases or to forward any such
        information to you or to any third party. Sections 1 and 3 through 22
        will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms for any
        reason.
      </p>
      <p>1. ENTIRE AGREEMENT</p>
      <p>
        These Terms constitute the entire legal agreement between you and
        Timeswap, govern your access to and use of the App and the services
        thereon, and completely replace any prior or contemporaneous agreements
        between the parties related to your access to or use of the App, whether
        oral or written.
      </p>
      <p>1. ASSIGNMENT</p>
      <p>
        You may not assign any or your rights or obligations under these Terms,
        whether by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written
        consent. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, we may assign our
        rights and obligations under these Terms in our sole discretion (without
        your consent) to an affiliate for any reason, including without
        limitation any assignment or novation in connection with a
        reincorporation to change Timeswap's domicile.
      </p>
      <p>1. INDEPENDENT PARTIES</p>
      <p>
        The parties are independent parties, and nothing in these Terms create
        any agency, partnership, joint venture or any similar relationship, nor
        cause the parties to be deemed acting in concert in any respect.
      </p>
      <p>1. SEVERABILITY</p>
      <p>
        Should any provision or part-provision of these Terms is or becomes
        invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any law of any
        jurisdiction, it shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent
        necessary to make it valid, legal and enforceable; if such modification
        is not possible, the relevant provision or part-provision shall be
        deemed deleted. Any modification to or deletion of a provision or
        part-provision pursuant to this Section 17 shall not affect or impair
        the validity and enforceability of the rest of these Terms, nor the
        validity and enforceability of such provision or part-provision under
        the law of any other jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>1. WAIVER</p>
      <p>
        Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not be deemed a
        waiver of such provision, nor of the right to enforce such provision.
      </p>
      <p>1. RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES</p>
      <p>
        There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms. A person who is
        not a party under these Terms has no right under the Contracts (Rights
        of Third Parties) Act, Chapter 53B of Singapore to enforce or to enjoy
        the benefit of these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>1. INTERPRETATION</p>
      <p>
        The language in these Terms will be interpreted as to its fair meaning,
        and not strictly for or against any party.
      </p>
      <p>1. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>
      <p>
        Please read this Section 21 carefully. It requires you to arbitrate
        disputes with Timeswap, and limits the manner in which you can seek
        relief from us.
      </p>
      <p>
        All disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms (including
        without limitation the enforceability of this Section 21 or any question
        regarding its existence, validity or termination, your access or use of
        the App or the services thereon App) shall be referred to and finally
        resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International
        Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of
        the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC Rules) for the time
        being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference
        in this Section 21. The seat of the arbitration shall be Singapore. The
        Tribunal shall consist of 1 arbitrator. The language of the arbitration
        shall be English. The award of the arbitrator will be final and binding,
        and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
        in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party will cover its own
        fees and costs associated with the arbitration proceedings.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, Timeswap may seek and obtain injunctive
        relief in any jurisdiction in any court of competent jurisdiction, and
        you agree that these Terms are specifically enforceable by Timeswap
        through injunctive relief and other equitable remedies without proof of
        monetary damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        WITH RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS,
        INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THE APP OR THE SERVICES
        THEREON: (A) YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BY
        JURY; AND (B) YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS
        A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS IN ANY LAWSUIT, INCLUDING BUT NOT
        LIMITED TO CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS INVOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTE.
      </p>
      <p>1. GOVERNING LAW</p>
      <p>
        These Terms and any dispute in connection with the same will be governed
        by and construed in accordance with the laws of Singapore, without
        regard to conflict of law rules and principles (whether of Singapore or
        any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of
        any other jurisdiction. You further agree that although the App may be
        available in various other jurisdictions, its availability does not give
        rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction in any forum outside
        Singapore.
      </p>
      <p>1. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF TIME TOKEN SALE</p>

        DEFINED BELOW) OR ANY INTERMEDIARY FOR THE ACQUISITION OF TIME TOKEN, OR
        BY CONTINUING TO HOLD OR USE TIME TOKEN WHICH YOU MAY HAVE OBTAINED BY
        ANY OTHER MEANS, YOU WILL BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND ALL TERMS
        INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU WILL BE
        ENTERING INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT WITH THE ISSUER, WHICH TERMS CONTAIN
        PROVISIONS WHICH AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. THE ACQUISITION, HOLDING AND
        USAGE OF DIGITAL TOKENS IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF RISKS (INCLUDING
        FINANCIAL RISK), SOME OF WHICH THE ISSUER HAS SET OUT IN THESE TERMS. IF
        YOU ARE IN ANY DOUBT AS TO THE SUITABILITY OR OTHERWISE OF ACQUIRING,
        HOLDING OR USAGE OF THE DIGITAL TOKENS REFERRED TO IN THESE TERMS, YOU
        SHOULD SEEK APPROPRIATE PROFESSIONAL ADVICE.
      </p>
      <p>

        HEREWITH.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your acquisition, whether through an intermediary or otherwise, of TIME
        Token from TIMESWAP LABS LTD., a company incorporated or to be
        incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (the Issuer, or us), as well
        as continued holding and/or usage of TIME Token is subject to these
        Terms and Conditions (the Terms). Each of you and the Issuer is a
        “Party,” and together the “Parties.” Please read the below terms and
        conditions carefully before registering, accessing, browsing,
        downloading and/or using the website at http://timeswap.io/ (the
        Website). By accessing or using the Website, acquiring TIME Token
        (whether through the token distribution, through an intermediary, or
        otherwise), or continuing to hold or use TIME Token, you agree to be
        bound by these Terms (and all terms incorporated by reference).
      </p>
      <p>
        Before agreeing to the Terms, you must read this document in full. If at
        any time you do not agree to these terms and conditions or do not wish
        to be bound by these terms and conditions, you may not access or use the
        Website, and shall not be entitled to acquire TIME Token (whether
        through an intermediary or otherwise) or continue to hold or use TIME
        Token. The Issuer shall be under no obligation to maintain a copy of
        these Terms on the Website after the distribution of TIME Token, and you
        are advised to print or download and keep a copy of these Terms for your
        future reference (if required).
      </p>
      <p>1. PURPOSE AND USAGE OF TOKENS</p>
      <p>
        TIME Token is a cryptographic utility token. The purpose of TIME Token
        is to facilitate the participation in the "Timeswap" protocol/network
        (the Timeswap Protocol) which, when fully developed, is envisaged to a
        fixed maturity lending and borrowing protocol for ERC20 tokens built on
        the Ethereum blockchain. The Timeswap Protocol is not, and will in no
        case be, an enterprise, corporation, partnership or other entity or body
        corporate established under the laws of any jurisdiction, but a
        computerised consensus protocol based on which a public transaction
        ledger is generated.
      </p>
      <p>
        TIME Token may be acquired by users who play the role of liquidity
        providers via the "liquidity mining" event (as described herein), or via
        other intermediaries/third party exchanges.
      </p>
      <p>
        TIME Token is to be distributed to users as incentives for contributions
        to and/or maintenance of the Timeswap Protocol. Given that additional
        TIME Token will be awarded to a user based only on its actual usage,
        activity and contribution on the Timeswap Protocol, users and/or holders
        of TIME Token which did not actively participate in the Timeswap
        Protocol will not receive any TIME Token incentives. In order for the
        Timeswap Protocol to function properly, users would need to be
        incentivised to play the role of liquidity providers and stake their
        digital assets into the loan/market making pools. As compensation for
        opportunity costs as well as lending losses, these liquidity providers
        which help to promote adoption of the Timeswap Protocol by staking or
        including assets to liquidity pools would be rewarded with TIME Token
        (i.e. "mining" on the Timeswap Protocol), according to each user's
        relative contribution after various adjustment and correction
        parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
        TIME Token would also allow holders to propose and vote on governance
        proposals to determine features and/or parameters of the Timeswap
        Protocol, with voting weight calculated in proportion to their token
        holdings (the right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features
        of the Timeswap Protocol; the right to vote does not entitle TIME Token
        holders to vote on the operation and management of the Company, its
        affiliates, or their assets, and does not constitute any equity interest
        in any of these entities).
      </p>
      <p>
        The precise scope of the Timeswap Protocol will be developed further and
        will be announced once finalised. For the avoidance of doubt, the
        community does not have legal control over any matters relating to the
        Issuer (or any of its affiliates) or any of its assets, or any of its
        affiliated companies (including without limitation the selection of
        governing board of the relevant company, over corporate matters,
        development direction, specific projects, or deployment of that
        company's assets, which shall be the final responsibility of the
        governing board of the relevant company).
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, TIME Token would have limited functionality. As development
        of the Timeswap Protocol progresses further, the various features of
        TIME Token would be implemented incrementally and become available over
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        TIME Token is an integral and indispensable part of the Timeswap
        Protocol because in the absence of TIME Token, there would be no
        economic incentive to motivate users to contribute, thus rendering the
        ecosystem on the Timeswap Protocol unsustainable. The ownership of TIME
        Token carries no rights, express or implied, in the Issuer, its related
        entitles or its affiliates (each, a Group Entity) other than the right
        to use TIME Token as a means to enable usage of and interaction with the
        Timeswap Protocol, upon the successful development and deployment of the
        Timeswap Protocol. TIME Token is sold as a useable virtual good, and
        does not have any functionality or utility outside the ecosystem on the
        Timeswap Protocol – accordingly it is not necessarily merchantable and
        does not necessarily have any other use or value. The ecosystem on the
        Timeswap Protocol is structured as a "closed system" in so far as the
        usage of TIME Token is concerned. Further, TIME Token is not a consumer
        product and to the maximum extent permitted by law, its holders accept
        explicitly and agree that they are not covered by the consumer
        protection regulation of any jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>You understand and accept that TIME Token:</p>

        <li>
          may only be utilised on the Timeswap Protocol, is non-refundable and

          any of their revenues or assets, including without limitation any

        other person make any representation or give any commitment as to its
        value).
      </p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that no Group Entity is under any obligation

      <p>
        IN PARTICULAR, PLEASE NOTE THAT THE ISSUER IS IN THE PROCESS OF
        UNDERTAKING LEGAL AND REGULATORY ANALYSIS OF THE FUNCTIONALITY OF TIME
        TOKEN. FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF THIS ANALYSIS, THERE MAY BE CHANGES
        TO THE INTENDED FUNCTIONALITY OF TIME TOKEN IN ORDER TO ENSURE
        COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LEGAL OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH THE ISSUER
        OR TIME TOKEN IS SUBJECT. IN THE EVENT OF ANY CHANGES TO THE INTENDED
        FUNCTIONALITY OF TIME TOKEN, THE DETAILS OF THE CHANGES SHALL BE
        PUBLISHED ON THE WEBSITE. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REGULARLY CHECK
        THE WEBSITE FOR ANY SUCH NOTICES.
      </p>
      <p>1. SCOPE OF TERMS</p>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise stated herein, your acquisition of TIME Token (whether
        through an intermediary or otherwise), and continued holding and/or
        usage of TIME Token is governed solely by these Terms. New terms or
        policies may be published from time to time on the Timeswap Protocol at
        our sole discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Issuer shall procure the development of the Timeswap Protocol in
        accordance with the roadmap as described in the Whitepaper, and shall
        procure that the Timeswap Protocol remains operational for a period of
        at least 5 years from the date hereof.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any potential future usage of TIME Token in connection with providing or
        receiving services or the usage of the Timeswap Protocol (when the same
        is completed and deployed) will be governed primarily by other
        applicable terms and policies (collectively, the Service Terms and
        Policies), which will be made available on the Timeswap Protocol and/or
        Website, if the services and the Timeswap Protocol is successfully
        completed and deployed. The Issuer may update these Terms or the Service
        Terms and Policies in our sole and absolute discretion. It shall be your
        responsibility to regularly check the Timeswap Protocol / Website for
        any such notices.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the extent of any conflict with these Terms, the updated Terms and
        the Service Terms and Policies which may be published from time to time
        on the Timeswap Protocol shall prevail with respect to any issues
        relating to the usage of TIME Token in connection with the Timeswap
        Protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Issuer reserves the right to require you to provide us with your
        personal details (including without limitation full legal name, address
        and details of the digital wallet from which you have sent the payment),
        and it is your responsibility to provide correct details. Failure to
        provide this information will prevent us from transferring TIME Token to
        your digital wallet.
      </p>
      <p>1. CANCELLATION AND REFUSAL AT ISSUER'S DISCRETION</p>
      <p>
        The distribution of TIME Token (whether through an intermediary or
        otherwise) by the Issuer is final; there are no refunds or exchange of
        Time Tokens except as may be required by applicable law or regulation,
        and you waive any rights to request for any refund or exchange of Time
        Token by the Issuer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer reserves the right to refuse
        to distribute TIME Token (as the case may be) to a user, at any time in
        its sole discretion without giving reasons, including without limitation
        the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          in connection with any failure to complete know-your-customer,
          anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing checks
          prescribed by the Issuer;
        </li>
        <li>
          in connection with a change of business or development plan of the
          Issuer; or
        </li>
        <li>
          in connection with an adverse change of the regulatory environment.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer shall not be required to notify
        you of the outcome of any of our customer identification, due diligence
        and/or anti-money laundering due diligence checks, or in any case
        provide reasons for unsatisfactory results of checks.
      </p>
      <p>
        At any time, the Issuer may either temporarily suspend or permanently
        abort the token distribution at its sole discretion without providing
        any reasons whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>1. ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND ASSUMPTION OF RISKS</p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with
        acquiring TIME Token, holding TIME Token, and using TIME Token for
        participation in the Timeswap Protocol. If you have any queries or
        require any clarification regarding these risks, please contact us at
        [*].
      </p>
      <p>
        YOU CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT BLOCKCHAIN AND VIRTUAL CURRENCIES / TOKENS,
        INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ETHEREUM, BITCOIN AND OTHER VIRTUAL
        CURRENCIES ARE NEW AND UNVERIFIED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE BEYOND CONTROL
        OF ANY GROUP ENTITY. IN PARTICULAR, AND IN ADDITION TO TERMS OF THIS
        DOCUMENT, YOU BEAR FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RISKS DESIGNATED IN THE
        PROPOSED DOCUMENTATION. BY ACQUIRING (WHETHER THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY OR
        OTHERWISE), HOLDING AND/OR USING TIME Token, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE
        AND ASSUME THE FOLLOWING RISKS:
      </p>
      <p>1. Risk of changes in functionality</p>
      <p>
        TIME Token does not have any rights, uses, purpose, attributes,
        functionalities or features, express or implied, except for those which
        are specifically described in the White Paper and which may change from
        time to time.
      </p>
      <p>1. TIME Token is non-refundable</p>
      <p>
        The Issuer is not obliged to provide TIME Token holders with a refund or
        any exchange related to TIME Token for any reason. No promises of future
        performance or price are or will be made in respect to TIME Token,
        including no promise of inherent value, no promise of continuing
        payments, and no guarantee that TIME Token will hold any particular
        value. Therefore, the recovery of spent resources may be impossible or
        may be subject to foreign laws or regulations, which may not be the same
        as the laws in the jurisdiction of TIME Token.
      </p>
      <p>1. Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions</p>
      <p>
        The regulatory status of TIME Token and distributed ledger technology is
        unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions, but numerous regulatory
        authorities across jurisdictions have been outspoken about considering
        the implementation of regulatory regimes which govern virtual currencies
        or virtual currency markets. It is impossible to predict how, when or
        whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or create new
        regulations with respect to such technology and its applications,
        including TIME Token and/or the Timeswap Protocol. Regulatory actions
        could negatively impact TIME Token and/or the Timeswap Protocol in
        various ways. The Issuer or any Group Entity may cease operations in a
        jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or
        regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or
        commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s)
        to operate in such jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>1. Risks associated with the Blockchain Protocol</p>
      <p>
        Given that TIME Token and the Timeswap Protocol are based on blockchain
        protocol and architecture, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of
        the relevant blockchain protocol or architecture may have a material
        adverse effect on TIME Token and/or the Timeswap Protocol. Moreover,
        advances in cryptography, or technical advances (including without
        limitation development of quantum computing), could present unknown
        risks to TIME Token and/or the Timeswap Protocol by rendering
        ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins that
        blockchain protocol. The future of cryptography and security innovations
        are highly unpredictable.
      </p>
      <p>1. Security</p>
      <p>
        You are responsible for implementing reasonable measures for securing
        the digital wallet, vault or other storage mechanism you use to receive
        and hold TIME Token which you have acquired, including any requisite
        passwords, tokens, private key(s) or other credentials necessary to
        access such storage mechanism(s). If your passwords, tokens, private
        key(s) or other access credentials are lost, you may lose access to your
        TIME Token. The Issuer cannot be responsible for, and is technologically
        unable to recover, any such losses.
      </p>
      <p>1. Insufficient Information</p>
      <p>
        The Timeswap Protocol is at the stage of development as of the date of
        these Terms and its algorithm, code, consensus mechanism and/or various
        other technical specifications and parameters could be updated and
        changed frequently and constantly. While the marketing materials and
        Whitepaper released relating to the development of the Timeswap Protocol
        has been prepared with the then up-to-date key information of the
        Timeswap Protocol, it is not absolutely complete and is subject to
        adjustments and updates from time to time for optimal development and
        growth of the Timeswap Protocol and/or ecosystem on the Timeswap
        Protocol. The Issuer is neither able, nor obliged, to keep you closely
        posted on every detail of the development of the Timeswap Protocol
        (including its progress and expected milestones no matter whether
        rescheduled or not) and therefore will not necessarily provide you with
        timely and full access to all the information relating to the Timeswap
        Protocol that may emerge from time to time. Due to the nature of the
        project to develop the Timeswap Protocol, you accept that such
        insufficiency of information disclosure is inevitable and reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>1. Security weaknesses.</p>
      <p>
        Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to
        interfere with TIME Token and/or the Timeswap Protocol in a variety of
        ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service
        attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing.
        Furthermore, there is a risk that a third party or a member of any Group
        Entity may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into
        the core infrastructure of TIME Token and/or the Timeswap Protocol,
        which could negatively affect TIME Token and/or the Timeswap Protocol.
      </p>
      <p>1. Risks associated with markets for TIME Token</p>
      <p>
        There is no prior market for TIME Token and the TIME token distribution
        may not result in an active or liquid market for TIME Token. TIME Token
        is intended to be used solely within the network for the Timeswap
        Protocol, hence there may be illiquidity risk with respect to any TIME
        Token you hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        TIME Token is not a currency issued by any central bank or national,
        supra-national or quasi-national organisation, nor is it backed by any
        hard assets or other credit nor is it a "commodity" in the usual and
        traditional sense of that word. The Issuer cannot be responsible for,
        nor does the Issuer pursue, the circulation and trading of TIME Token on
        any market. Trading of TIME Token will merely depend on the consensus on
        its value between the relevant market participants. No one is obliged to
        acquire any TIME Token from any holder of TIME Token, including the
        Issuer, nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity or market price of TIME
        Token to any extent at any time. Furthermore, TIME Token may not be
        resold to a party who is a citizen, national, resident (tax or
        otherwise), domiciliary or green card holder of a Restricted Country or
        to a party where the acquisition of TIME Token may be in violation of
        applicable laws. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot ensure that there will
        be any demand or market for TIME Token, or that the price you pay for
        TIME Token is indicative of any market valuation or market price for
        TIME Token.
      </p>
      <p>1. Risk of Uninsured Losses</p>
      <p>
        TIME Token is uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance
        to insure them. In the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is
        no public insurer or private insurance arranged by us, to offer recourse
        to you.
      </p>
      <p>1. Taxation risks</p>
      <p>
        The tax characterisation of TIME Token is uncertain. The tax
        characterisation of TIME Token and these Terms is uncertain. The Issuer
        intends to treat TIME Token and these Terms neither as an equity
        interest nor as a debt interest in the Issuer for tax purposes. It is
        possible that the Issuer’s intended treatment of TIME Token and these
        Terms may be challenged, so that the tax consequences to a participant
        of the TIME Token distribution and the Issuer relating to TIME Token and
        these Terms could differ from those described above. You must seek your
        own tax advice in connection with the acquisition, holding and/or usage
        of TIME Token, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you,
        including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting
        requirements.
      </p>
      <p>1. Competitors</p>
      <p>
        It is possible that alternative networks could be established that
        utilise the same or similar code and protocol underlying TIME Token
        and/or the Timeswap Protocol and attempt to re-create similar
        facilities. The Timeswap Protocol may be required to compete with these
        alternative networks, which could negatively impact TIME Token and/or
        the Timeswap Protocol.
      </p>
      <p>1. Insufficient Interest</p>
      <p>
        It is possible that the Timeswap Protocol will not be used by a large
        number of individuals, companies and other entities or that there will
        be limited public interest in the creation and development of
        distributed ecosystems (such as the Timeswap Protocol). Such a lack of
        use or interest could negatively impact the development of the Timeswap
        Protocol and therefore the potential utility of TIME Token.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Risk of Dissolution of the Issuer, any Group Entity or the Timeswap
        Protocol
      </p>
      <p>
        Start-up companies such as the Issuer involve a high degree of risk.
        Financial and operating risks confronting start-up companies are
        significant, and the Issuer is not immune to these. Start-up companies
        often experience unexpected problems in the areas of product
        development, marketing, financing, and general management, among others,
        which frequently cannot be solved.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not
        limited to, an unfavourable fluctuation in the value of virtual and/or
        fiat currencies, decrease in the utility of TIME Token due to negative
        adoption of the Timeswap Protocol, the failure of commercial
        relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the
        Timeswap Protocol may no longer be viable to operate and the Issuer or
        any Group Entity may be dissolved.
      </p>
      <p>1. Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights</p>
      <p>
        Because TIME Token confers no governance rights of any kind with respect
        to the Timeswap Protocol or any Group Entity, all decisions involving
        the Timeswap Protocol or any Group Entity will be made by the relevant
        Group Entity at its sole and absolute discretion, including, but not
        limited to, decisions to discontinue the services and/or ecosystem on
        the Timeswap Protocol, to create and distribute more TIME Token for use
        in the ecosystem on the Timeswap Protocol, or to sell or liquidate any
        Group Entity. These decisions could adversely affect the Timeswap
        Protocol and TIME Token you hold.
      </p>
      <p>1. Loss of Talent</p>
      <p>
        The development of the Timeswap Protocol depends on the continued
        co-operation of the existing technical team and expert consultants, who
        are highly knowledgeable and experienced in their respective sectors.
        The loss of any member may adversely affect the Timeswap Protocol or its
        future development. Further, stability and cohesion within the team is
        critical to the overall development of the Timeswap Protocol. There is
        the possibility that conflict within the team and/or departure of core
        personnel may occur, resulting in negative influence on the project in
        the future.
      </p>
      <p>1. Failure to develop</p>
      <p>
        There is the risk that the development of the Timeswap Protocol will not
        be executed or implemented as planned, for a variety of reasons,
        including without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any
        digital asset, virtual currency or TIME Token, unforeseen technical
        difficulties, and shortage of development funds for activities.
      </p>
      <p>1. Risks Involving Cloud Storage</p>
      <p>
        As the Timeswap Protocol may provide a decentralised cloud storage
        service to individual and institutional clients, including users and
        applications, the Timeswap Protocol (and services thereon) are
        susceptible to a number of risks related to the storage of data in the
        cloud. The Timeswap Protocol (and services thereon) may involve the
        storage of large amounts of sensitive and/or proprietary information,
        which may be compromised in the event of a cyberattack or other
        malicious activity. Similarly, the Timeswap Protocol and/or services
        thereon may be interrupted and files may become temporarily unavailable
        in the event of such an attack or malicious activity. Because users can
        use a variety of hardware and software that may interface with the
        Timeswap Protocol, there is the risk that the Timeswap Protocol and/or
        services thereon may become unavailable or interrupted based on a
        failure of interoperability or an inability to integrate these
        third-party systems and devices that the Group Entities do not control.
        The risk that the Timeswap Protocol and/or services thereon may face
        increasing interruptions and the ecosystem on the Timeswap Protocol may
        face additional security vulnerabilities could adversely affect the
        Timeswap Protocol and ecosystem thereon, and therefore the future
        utility of any TIME Token that you hold.
      </p>
      <p>1. Forking</p>
      <p>
        The Timeswap Protocol is a community project and certain elements are
        open-sourced. The Issuer (nor any Group Entity) does not and cannot
        monopolise the development, marketing, operation or otherwise of the
        Timeswap Protocol. Any entity may independently develop a patch or
        upgrade of the source code of the Timeswap Protocol or blockchain
        without prior authorisation of any other party. The acceptance of these
        patches or upgrades by a sufficient (not necessarily overwhelming)
        percentage of TIME Token holders could result in a “fork” in the
        blockchain, and consequently two diverging networks will emerge and
        remain. Each branch of the blockchain arising from the fork will have
        its own native cryptographic tokens – accordingly there will be two
        different versions of TIME Token respectively residing in the two
        divergent branches with almost identical technical features and
        functions. The community on the Timeswap Protocol may split into two
        groups in support of the two branches respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, it is theoretically possible for each branch of the forked
        blockchain to be further forked an unlimited number of times. The
        temporary or permanent existence of forked blockchains could adversely
        affect the operation of the Timeswap Protocol and blockchain and the
        TIME Token which you hold, and may ruin the sustainability of the
        Timeswap Protocol.
      </p>
      <p>1. Other risks</p>
      <p>
        In addition to the aforementioned risks, there are other risks
        associated with your participation in the TIME Token distribution, as
        well as holding and usage of TIME Token, including those that the Issuer
        cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated
        variations or combinations of the aforementioned risks.
      </p>
      <p>1. KNOW YOUR CLIENT REGULATIONS AND PERSONAL DATA</p>
      <p>Know your client regulations</p>
      <p>You hereby acknowledge and accept that:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The Issuer may be required to conduct customer identification, due
          diligence and anti-money laundering due diligence on all holders of
          TIME Token in compliance with all applicable laws and legislations.
          The Issuer may determine, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary
          to obtain certain information about you in order to comply with these
          laws and legislations. You agree to provide such information to the
          Issuer promptly upon request, and you acknowledge that the Issuer may
          refuse to distribute TIME Token to you until you provide such
          requested information and the Issuer has determined that it is
          permissible to distribute TIME Token to you under applicable law or
          regulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Issuer may at any point in time request information and/or
          documentation to establish that its identification records, as well as
          the information that form your profile, remain completely updated. In
          this respect, the Issuer reserves the right to examine and check on a
          regular basis the validity and adequacy of your identification data
          and information maintained. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer
          shall not be required to notify you of the outcome of any of its
          customer identification, due diligence and/or anti-money laundering
          due diligence checks, or in any case provide reasons for
          unsatisfactory results of checks.
        </li>
        <li>
          If at any time the Issuer becomes aware that reliable or adequate data
          and information are missing from your identity, the Issuer reserves
          the right to take all necessary actions to collect the missing data
          and information (whether from you or from third parties) so as to

      <p>1. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>
      <p>
        These Terms will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance
        with the laws of Singapore, without regard to conflict of law rules or
        principles (whether of Singapore or any other jurisdiction) that would
        cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute
        arising out of or in connection with these Terms (including without
        limitation the enforceability of this arbitration Clause, any question
        regarding existence, validity or termination) shall be referred to and
        finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore
        International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in accordance with the
        Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre
        (SIAC Rules) for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be
        incorporated by reference in this arbitration Clause. The seat of the
        arbitration shall be Singapore. The Tribunal shall consist of 1
        arbitrator. The language of the arbitration shall be English.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Party agrees to keep all matters relating to this arbitration,
        including the arbitral awards, confidential, except as is otherwise
        required by court order or as is necessary to confirm, set aside or
        enforce the arbitral award and for disclosure in confidence to each
        Party’s respective legal, financial or other professional advisors.
      </p>
      <p>1. PARTIAL INVALIDITY</p>
      <p>
        If, at any time, any provision of these Terms is or becomes illegal,
        invalid or unenforceable in any respect under any law of any
        jurisdiction, neither the legality, validity or enforceability of the
        remaining provisions nor the legality, validity or enforceability of
        such provision under the law of any other jurisdiction will in any way
        be affected or impaired.
      </p>
      <p>1. TERMINATION</p>
      <p>
        The Issuer reserves the right to terminate the agreement set out in
        these Terms, in its sole discretion, in the event of a breach by you of
        these Terms. Upon termination of these Terms:
      </p>
      <p>1. all of your rights under these Terms immediately terminate; and</p>
      <p>
        2. Clauses 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 17, 18 and 19 will continue to apply in
        accordance with their terms to you in respect of any TIME Token held.
      </p>
      <p>3. ENTIRE AGREEMENT</p>
      <p>
        These Terms, including the documents and material incorporated by
        reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and the Issuer
        and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements and
        understandings (including without limitation the Whitepaper or any other
        marketing material), both written and oral, between you and the Issuer
        with respect to the subject matters. The Issuer may make changes to
        these Terms from time to time as reasonably required to comply with
        applicable law or regulation. If the Issuer makes changes, it will as
        soon as practicable post the amended Terms at the Website. The amended
        Terms will be effective immediately. It is your responsibility to
        regularly check the Website for any such amendments.
      </p>
      <p>1. ASSIGNMENT</p>
      <p>
        You shall under no circumstances be entitled to assign or novate your
        rights and obligations under these Terms (including without limitation
        the right to claim any TIME Token). The Issuer may assign or novate its
        rights and obligations under these Terms without your consent, and you
        agree to, at your own expense, take whatever action or execute any
        document which the Issuer may require for the purpose of effecting any
        such assignment or novation by the Issuer.
      </p>
      <p>1. REMEDIES AND WAIVERS</p>
      <p>
        No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on our part, any
        right or remedy under these Terms Documents shall operate as a waiver,
        of any such right or remedy or constitute an election to affirm these
        Terms. No election to affirm these Terms on our part shall be effective
        unless it is in writing. No single or partial exercise of any right or
        remedy prevents any further or other exercise or the exercise of any
        other right or remedy. The rights and remedies provided in these Terms
        are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by
        law.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>DISCLAIMERS</li>
        <li>
          You expressly acknowledge, understand and agree that you are acquiring
          (whether through an intermediary or otherwise), holding and/or using
          TIME Token at your sole risk and discretion, and that TIME Token is
          provided, used and distributed on an “AS IS” and on an “AS AVAILABLE”
          basis without any representations, warranties, promises or guarantees
          whatsoever of any kind by the Issuer or any Group Entity. Prior to
          making any decision to acquire (whether through an intermediary or
          otherwise), hold and/or use TIME Token, you shall conduct your own due
          diligence and rely only on your own examination and investigation
          thereof.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changes in relevant laws and regulations in any jurisdictions which
          the Issuer is operating shall constitute a force majeure and the
          Issuer will not be responsible for any result arising out of such
          changes in relevant laws and regulations.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Issuer does not make and expressly disclaims all representations
          and warranties, express, implied or statutory; and with respect to
          TIME Token, the Issuer specifically does not represent and warrant and
          expressly disclaims any representation or warranty, express, implied
          or statutory, including without limitation, any representations or
          warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability, usage,
          suitability or fitness for any particular purpose, or as to the
          workmanship or technical coding thereof, or the absence of any defects
          therein, whether latent or patent. In addition, the Issuer cannot and
          does not represent or warrant that TIME Token or the delivery
          mechanism for TIME Token are free of viruses or other harmful
          components.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Issuer assumes that you have already read these Terms, especially
          the risks and disclaimer stated herein and hereunder, and you shall
          automatically be regarded agree to take all risks (including but not
          limited to the risks stated herein) in relation to acquiring (whether
          through an intermediary or otherwise), holding and/or using TIME
          Token.
        </li>
        <li>ISSUER NOT LIABLE</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        TIME Token is not being structured or sold as securities or any other
        form of investment product. Accordingly, none of the information
        presented in these Terms is intended to form the basis for any
        investment decision, and no specific recommendations are intended. Save
        in the case of fraud or gross negligence, the Issuer expressly disclaims
        any and all responsibility for any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, consequential or exemplary loss or damage of any kind
        whatsoever arising directly or indirectly (including without limitation,
        those relating to loss of revenue, income or profits, loss of use or
        data, or damages for business interruption) in connection with:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>reliance on any information contained in these terms;</li>
        <li>any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such information;</li>
        <li>any action resulting from such information; or</li>
        <li>the distribution or usage of TIME Token.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In no event will the aggregate liability of the Issuer and the
        Indemnified Parties (jointly), whether in contract, warranty, tort, or
        other theory, arising out of or relating to these terms or the usage of
        or inability to use TIME Token, exceed the amount you pay to us for TIME
        Token.
      </p>
      <p>1. CLAIMS</p>
      <p>
        The Issuer shall not be liable in any way or in any event in respect of
        any claim under these Terms if such claim was not made within the
        6-month period commencing from the date that you receive TIME Token (the
        Claim Period). Any claim which has been made before the expiration of
        the Claim Period shall, if it has not been previously satisfied in full,
        settled or withdrawn, be deemed to have been withdrawn and shall become
        fully barred and unenforceable on the expiry of the period of six (6)
        months commencing from the date on which such claim was made, unless
        proceedings in respect thereof shall have been commenced against the
        Issuer and for this purpose proceedings shall not be deemed to have been
        commenced unless they shall have been issued and served upon the Issuer.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in these Terms shall limit your
        obligation (at law or otherwise) to mitigate your loss in respect of any
        claim under these Terms, and you shall not be entitled to recover
        damages in respect of any claim (as the case may be) if, and to the
        extent that, you have already recovered damages in respect of the same
        fact or subject matter.
      </p>
      <p>1. PARTNERSHIP</p>
      <p>
        Acquiring (whether through an intermediary or otherwise), holding and/or
        using TIME Token does not create any form of partnership, joint venture
        or any other similar relationship between you and us, nor cause the
        Parties to be deemed acting in concert in any respect.
      </p>
      <p>1. CONFIDENTIALITY</p>
      <p>
        You shall hold, and shall cause your affiliates, officers, directors,
        employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents to
        hold, in confidence all documents, information and correspondence
        concerning TIME Token or any Group Entity furnished to you or your
        affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by these
        Terms or any pre-contractual or post-contractual negotiations in
        connection therewith (including without limitation all commercial
        information such as number of tokens distribution, conditions of such
        token distribution, as well as schedule for delivery of tokens), except
        to the extent that such information can be shown to have been (a)
        previously known on a non-confidential basis by you, (b) in the public
        domain disclosed without any fault on your part or (c) later lawfully
        acquired by you from sources other than any Group Entity.  If these
        Terms are terminated, you shall, and shall cause your affiliates,
        officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants,
        advisors and agents to, destroy or deliver to the Issuer, upon request,
        all documents and other materials, and all copies thereof, obtained by
        you or your affiliates in connection with these Terms that are subject
        to such confidence.
      </p>
      <p>1. RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES</p>
      <p>
        Except as otherwise provided in herein, these Terms are intended solely
        for the benefit of you and us and are not intended to confer third-party
        beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. A person who is not
        a party under these Terms has no right under the Contracts (Rights of
        Third Parties) Act, Chapter 53B of Singapore to enforce or to enjoy the
        benefit of any term of these Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
        Group entity shall be entitled to enforce or to enjoy the benefit of any
        term of these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>1. LANGUAGE</p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge that, solely for convenience, these Terms may be
        translated into a language other than English, and that a copy of the
        English language version of these Terms has been provided to you (which
        have read and understand). In the event of conflict or ambiguity between
        the English language version and translated versions of these Terms, the
        English language version shall prevail.
      </p>
      <p>1. SEVERABILITY</p>
      <p>
        If any provision or part-provision of these Terms is or becomes invalid,
        illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any law of any
        jurisdiction, it shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent
        necessary to make it valid, legal and enforceable.  If such modification
        is not possible, the relevant provision or part-provision shall be
        deemed deleted.  Any modification to or deletion of a provision or
        part-provision pursuant to this Clause 24 shall not affect or impair the
        validity and enforceability of the rest of these Terms, nor the validity
        and enforceability of such provision or part-provision under the law of
        any other jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>1. INTERPRETATION</p>
      <p>
        The language in these Terms will be interpreted as to its fair meaning,
        and not strictly for or against any party.
      </p>
      <p>1. NOTICES</p>
      <p>
        You agree and acknowledge that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and
        other communications that the Issuer provides to you, including these
        Terms, will be provided in electronic form.
